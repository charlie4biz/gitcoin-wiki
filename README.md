Gitcoin is a decentralized application platform built on the Ethereum Network to create a marketplace for Github Open Source Contributors to get compensated for their contributions. Founded by Kevin Owocki in Boulder Colorado, it was launched in September 2017 and later joined ConsenSys' Bounties Network; a similar project to Gitcoin, sharing the growing number of users and bounties.

Gitcoin creates an avenue for repository manager of a project to set up bounties for tasks and issues to be worked on by bounty hunters called Contributors and get paid in cryptocurrencies, thereby enabling Repo Maintainers, developers, and financiers to find one another. 

The platform has two kinds of users; Funders and Contributors. Funders create bounties on tasks and Contributors work on such tasks. Funders can setup bounties that requires just one Contributor who gets paid after completion of the task or set up a cooperative bounty where multiply Contributors get paid or simply set up a Competition bounty where only one Contributor will be paid after selection from the many Contributors. 

Part of Gitcoin monetization process is managing projects for companies with consultancy services, for a fee. Since its relaunch in November 2017, it has helped 327 funders reach an audience of 17,977 developers and has facilitated 2,827 complete transactions to 813 unique coders.

The startup also provides an opportunity for other open sources developers and maintainers to get funding for their projects through Gitcoin Grant. Built with EIP1337 standard,  Financiers can make recurring token contributions to their favorite OSS maintainers. Contributors to a project could also be tipped for their contribution using Kudos; an ERC 721 Non Fungible Token that can be used to show appreciation for, and build relationships with contributors.
